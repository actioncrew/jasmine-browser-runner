# jasmine-browser-runner 3.0.0 Release Notes

## Breaking Changes

* Default to localhost when a listenAddress is not specified

  Previously, jasmine-browser-runner defaulted to listening on the address
  specified by the hostname config value if specified or all network
  interfaces if neither  listenAddress nor hostname was specified. This
  change improves security by not allowing connections from other hosts unless
  that's been explicitly requested.

* Removed redundant options parameter from Server#start

  If you were passing options to Server#start, pass them to the Server
  constructor instead.

* Removed redundant second options parameter from startServer

  If you were passing two options parameters to startServer, combine them into
  a single parameter.

* Removed legacy Saucelabs support

  jasmine-browser-runner can still be used with Saucelabs via the remote
  Selenium grid feature. See the README for details.

* The expected and actual properties of 
  [expectation results](https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.6/global.html#ExpectationResult)
  are not passed to reporters.

* Removed the --reporter= CLI option

* Removed the useHtmlReporter config option

* Updated to Express 5.0

  This may be a breaking change if your jasmine-browser-runner configuration
  adds any Express middleware that isn't compatible with Express 5. See the
  [Express 5 migration guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html)
  for details. If your configuration doesn't contain a `middleware` property,
  you don't need to change anything.

* The minimum jasmine-core version is now 5.5.0.

## New Features

* Allow ES modules in the src directory, for use in incrementally migrating
  codebases to ES modules
  * Merges [#60](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/pull/60) 
    and [#65](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/pull/65) from 
    @HolgerJeromin

* Set [forbidDuplicateNames](https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.6/Configuration.html#forbidDuplicateNames)
  to true in newly generated configs

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed Selenium error when the expected value in a failed expectation is a
  detached DOM node
  * Fixes [#67](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/issues/67)

* Fixed intermittent mis-ordering of ESM specs
  * Fixes [#62](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/issues/62)

## Documentation updates

* Demoted Safari to best-effort support

  Due to limited availability of Safari versions for contributors and maintainers
  as well as in CI, Safari will be supported on the same best-effort basis as
  environments that are past end of life, such as previous Firefox ESR versions.
  See [this discussion](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/discussions/2050) for
  more information about why this change was made and what to expect.

* Added Firefox 128 (current ESR) and Node 22 to supported environments

* Fixed default esmFilenameExtension in README
  * Merges [#59](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/pull/59) from 
    @HolgerJeromin

if it becomes impractical, and bugs affecting only these versions may not be 
treated as release blockers.
